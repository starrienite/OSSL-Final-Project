# Jeopardy Game & Game Editor
## OSSL 2021-1 Final Project

## Purpose of the program:
This program provides a fun Jeopardy-like game, where questions are divided into five categories and different point-values are awarded based on the difficulty of the question. In the game, the user can pick a question by its category and point-value. Then, the user can also choose to view the answer after the question is displayed. It is assumed that there are several players/teams and thus, the user must choose to view the answer (once a player/team has attempted an answer). It is also assumed that the points are rewarded and tracked based on who provides the correct answer.

Another feature of this program is that it allows the user to edit the questions or change the categories altogether. Thus, the user can create their own version of the game and play it with their friends, teammates, or classmates.

## Uses for the program:
Personally, I was inspired to write this program because at Handong Global University, I am sometimes in a situation where I have to brainstorm fun games and activities (i.e. for Team Meetings or for the youth at church.) Recently, I prepared a Jeopardy game for a Youth Ministry meeting at HIC but I could not find a good skeleton/template for the game. I ended up making my own version on Powerpoint, but it was a massive hassle to link all the slides to the main board and another wanting-to-pull-my-hair-out situation when the slide numbers changed. Consequently, I decided to write a program that is much more user-friendly and more easily accessible.

In general, this program can be used by anyone to provide a fun activity or icebreaker for their group meetings or community-building exercises. It is highly useful because the user can easily edit the questions to fit their situations and/or communities.

## Get Started:
Simply copy the files to your coding environment, compile and run (through the Makefile), and you're good to go! Enjoy!

## Contributions and Possible Further Expansions
I built this program (and all files) from scratch.

Furthermore, other possible expansions that I would want to explore in the future are:
 1. Adding a scorekeeping feature 
 2. Creating multiple rounds where sometimes the point-values are doubled for each question
 3. Creating a more appealing visual console for the game such as a website (so that it is easy-to-use for even non-programmers)
 4. Allowing different question formats such as categories where:
    * music is played and players have to guess the song 
    * an audio clip is played and players have to guess the movie (and the answer-reveal would include the video clip.)
    * an image is displayed and players have to guess what the image is displaying (Guess the Person, Guess the Campus Building, Guess the Object of this Super-Zoomed in Photo.)
